encounters with lambda abstraction in spreadsheets</a></td>
<td>The value of computational abstractions to non-expert end-user
programmers is contentious. We study reactions to the lambda function in
Microsoft Excel, which enables users to define their own functions using
the spreadsheet formula language, through a thematic analysis of nearly
2,700 comments posted on the Reddit, Hacker News, YouTube, and Microsoft
Tech Community online forums. We find that computational abstractions
are viewed both as helpful and harmful, that users encounter learning
and understanding barriers to applying them, and that there are
deficiencies and opportunities in tooling such as in formula editing,
versioning, reuse and sharing. We find that the introduction of lambda
prompts new debate around whether spreadsheets are code, whether writing
formulas can be considered programming, and whether spreadsheet users
identify themselves as programmers.</td>
